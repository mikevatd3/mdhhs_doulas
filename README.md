# MDHHS Doulas registry

There is a javascript file that holds all of the doulas in this object-assign type of format. I'm not sure how to make sense of the versions yet. Here is the link as of 2024-12-03: `https://mdhhs-pres-prod.michigan.gov/DoulaMap/data/Doulas.js?version=229368`

This project has a step to access that file, transform it into csv, then upload it.
